Hey, This is a small Python project implementing polynomials using degrees of X > 0. It aims to showcase the ability of computers to approximate the roots, derivatives, and point values of each
function.

*To use:*

When defining a function, use the variable X, because using a lowercase x will cause an error. You also need to specify the exponent by using ^. Finally, you place the sign of the
coefficient next to it without a space to avoid errors. Fractions cannot be used as coefficients.

Valid inputs include:\
3X^3 +4X^2 -3X^1 +2\
X^45 -458585X^2 +3000\
5X^2 -4X^1 +1\
2X^1 -4

**Thank you for reading to the end, this should be enough to use the program, it'll guide you through the rest.**
